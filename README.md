A simple web application built using Node.js, Expressjs and OpenWeather API that fetches the weather data such as max/min temp,
wind velocity, a brief description of the weather as an API response in JSON for a searched location by the user. And finally the app is deployed in AWS EC2
The WeatherApp is live here:http://3.19.229.57:3000
